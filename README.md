# Error Handling Exercise

Hello, future software developer! In this exercise, you’ll practice error handling. 🔥

As a detective 🕵️ at Shadow Sleuths 🥷, you’ll attend mysterious operations using the `mysteryOperation` function. If the operation is successful 🍻, it prints to the console; if it fails 🦹, it throws an error!

The bureau gives you 13 days of vacation if an operation is successful, if unsuccessful, you’ll receive one day for your motivation. In both situations, they also give you three days for your attendance. This year, you will attend 20 missions. Code this logic using `try`/`catch`/`finally`, and print how many days of vacation you deserve!

Hint: Remember, `try` runs until there is an error, `catch` runs when there is an error, and `finally` runs always after both `try` and `catch` finished.
